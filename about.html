                whatdafuq was created on a warm wednesday afternoon over a zoom call. it started as a challenge, 
                something to get the students excited... and it evolved from there. all of our products are ethically-sourced
                and made to last a lifetime (or two). our aim to have a little bit of everything for a little bit
                of everyone, and we believe everyone deserves to feel proud of who they are - and where they shop.
